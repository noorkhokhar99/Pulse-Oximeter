The sensor is integrated pulse oximetry and heart-rate monitor sensor solution. It combines two LEDâ€™s, a photodetector, optimized optics, and low-noise analog signal processing to detect pulse and heart-rate signals. It operates from 1.8V and 3.3V power supplies and can be powered down through software with negligible standby current, permitting the power supply to remain connected at all times.
